    // --- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---

    // -------
    // You're launched high into the atmosphere! The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface
    // of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It's quite cold,
    // but you don't see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.

    // The Elf explains that you've arrived at Snow Island and apologizes for the lack of snow. He'll be happy to explain
    // the situation, but it's a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don't get many visitors up here;
    // would you like to play a game in the meantime?

    // As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue.
    // Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag,
    // and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.

    // To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes,
    // show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He'll do this a few times per game.

    // You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input).
    // Each game is listed with its ID number(like the 11 in Game 11: ...) followed by a semicolon-separated
    // list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag(like 3 red, 5 green, 4 blue).

    // For example, the record of a few games might look like this:

    // Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
    // Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
    // Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
    // Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
    // Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
    // In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag(and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and
    // 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.

    // The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes,
    // 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?

    // In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with that configuration.
    // However, game 3 would have been impossible because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once;
    // similarly, game 4 would also have been impossible because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once.
    // If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get 8.

    // Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes,
    // and 14 blue cubes. What is the sum of the IDs of those games?

    // --- Part Two ---
    // The Elf says they've stopped producing snow because they aren't getting any water! He isn't sure why the water stopped;
    // however, he can show you how to get to the water source to check it out for yourself. It's just up ahead!

    // As you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes
    // of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?

    // Again consider the example games from earlier:

    // Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
    // Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
    // Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
    // Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
    // Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green

    // In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes.
    // If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.

    // Game 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.
    // Game 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes.
    // Game 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes.
    // Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag.
    // The power of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together.
    // The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is 48. In games 2-5 it was 12, 1560, 630, and 36, respectively.
    // Adding up these five powers produces the sum 2286.

    // For each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present.What is the sum of the power of these sets?
